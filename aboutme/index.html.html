    <p>Hello everybody, I am from Venezuela, I love learning and playing violin, I'm married to an awesome wife, we have two little boys, and I like to spend time together as a family, technology is for me a passion always I am seeking to learn and improve on this, that's why my career is in applied technology. I have some experience building web site but never work in a real company with this. I don't want to say that I know all but that I want to learn more than other times and work with this really.</p>
